## Overview

This project aims to analyze the types of movies that generates the most revenue. Factors such as the movie's ratings (PG, G, PG-13, etc.), number of votes for scores it received, as well as the average of the users' scores by genres were used to help determine which type(s) of movies Microsoft should create.  

### Business Problem

Microsoft does not have prior experience in the film industry, and needs to minimize the risk of entering a new industry. However, there are numerous genres of movies as well as the budgeting problem. This project aims to aid Microsoft by providing datas related to these problems.
