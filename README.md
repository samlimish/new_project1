## Overview

This project aims to analyze the types of movies that generates the most revenue. Factors such as the movie's ratings (PG, G, PG-13, etc.), number of votes for scores it received, as well as the average of the users' scores by genres were used to help determine which type(s) of movies Microsoft should create.  

## Business Problem

Microsoft does not have prior experience in the film industry, and needs to minimize the risk of entering a new industry. However, there are numerous genres of movies as well as the budgeting problem. This project aims to aid Microsoft by providing datas related to these problems.

## Data

Using databases from movie review websites such as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, and The Movie Database, this project was able to assess different movie genres' and ratings' (PG, PG-13, etc.) popularity, as well as how each genre did in the box office. For movies that had multiple genres, each of its genre were given same ratings, number of votes, as well as box office profits. 

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis to find relations between the movies' genres and earnings as well as relationship between the budget and gross revenue.

## Results

Since it can be assumed that the movies with the most number of user rating votes are the most popular to the general public, movies with genres such as Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Action received the most attention.

In terms of box office revenues, the Science Fiction and Fantasy genre performed the best, followed by Action and Adventure, Animation, and Kids and Family. However, the overwhelming revenue in the Science Fiction and Fantasy genre can be attributed to popular franchises such as the Marvel series, the Starwars series, and the Avatar. These franchises have been able to outperform most of its competitors through their prolonged presence in the industry(Marvel/Starwars) and innovative features such as 3D movie experience(Avatar).

As for the relationship between Motion Picture Association's ratings and the movie's overall performance, data shows that PG movies offer the most value. The first graph shows the number of movies per MPA rating, and the second graph shows the overall box office revenue per MPA rating. While the PG-13 category earned the most box office revenue, the number of PG-13 movies were more than double the number of PG movies which was not reciprocated in the box office revenue.
